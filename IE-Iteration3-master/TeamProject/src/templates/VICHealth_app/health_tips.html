          <p>The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommend swimming lessons for children <strong>age 4 or above</strong>.(VeryWell, 2019)</p>
          <p>However, AAP no longer opposed to aquatic programs and swimming lessons for toddlers and pre-schoolers between the age of 1 to 4 years old.</p>
          <br>
          <h6>Benefits:</h6>
          <p>-  By teaching your child to swim, he will not only become a strong swimmer but will also gain valuable experience in the water. It will protect the child when he accidentally falls into the water.</p>

          <p>-	Kids should learn how to use protective devices.</p>
          <p>-	Whenever a kid is missing, check the pool first.</p>

          <p><strong>5 years old</strong> is good to play at school and <strong>age 7</strong> is enough for training.(Life, 2019)</p>
          <br>
          <h6>Benefits:</h6>
          <p>-  Soccer gives your child a great cardiovascular workout. They also help to increase flexibility and strength.</p>
          <p>-  Teamwork is one of the hardest things to learn if your child does not participate in team sports. As a team sport, football players must unite to be successful. Teamwork is the skill you need to succeed in school, work and home.</p>
          <p>-  Soccer helps strengthen the core muscles and hand-eye coordination. It makes children move more actively and become healthier.</p>
          <p>-  Playing soccer can help children enhance their self-confidence. Achieving some achievement, such as a goal, will improve your child's confience.</p>
          <br>
          <h6>Safety tips:</h6>
          <p>-	Check the field to make sure there are no holes or other obstacles, including debris and broken glass. Store extra balls and equipment well off to the sides of the field before a practice or game starts</p>
          <p>-	Check the goals at each end of the field to make sure they're safe. Goals should be attached to the ground, and goal posts should be well padded. If the field is wet, use synthetic, nonabsorbent balls. Leather balls can become waterlogged and very heavy, increasing the risk of injury.</p>
          <p>-	Remove any piercings or jewelry before playing.</p>
          <p>-	Always warm up and stretch before playing.</p>
          <p>-	Learn and use proper techniques, especially when heading the ball.</p>
          <p>-	Stop training if they get hurt or feel pain. Players should get checked by an athletic trainer, coach, doctor, or nurse before going back on the field.</p>
          <p>-	Stay hydrated, particularly on hot, sunny days, by drinking plenty of fluids before, during, and after games and practices.</p>

          <p>Common causes of football injuries are being tackled, collisions with another player, hit by the ball and falls. Injuries to the thigh, knee, lower leg and ankle are the most common non-hospital-treated injuries. Hospital-admitted injuries (which make up 30% of all Australian Football hospital
            presentations) are usually fractures, sprains or strains affecting the wrists, hands, shoulders, head or face, lower leg and knee.</p>
          <br>
          <p>Be prepared to play AFL</p>
          <p>Remember to:</p>
          <p>-	Train before the season so your body is ready to compete. Pre-season training can improve strength, flexibility, stamina, agility and balance.</p>
          <p>-	Learn, practise and use correct skills and techniques before playing.</p>
          <p>-	Do a complete warm-up, including stretching, slow jogging and running activities, with and without a football.</p>

          <p>-	Drink water before, during and after a game or training session.</p>
          <p>-	Avoid drinking alcohol 48 hours before a game and straight after a game.</p>
          <br>
          <p>Provide a safe environment for AFL</p>
          <p>Suggestions include:</p>
          <p>-	Check the ground to remove or cover hazardous objects, such as broken glass or sprinkler heads.</p>
          <p>-	Make sure fences are a minimum of three metres from the boundary line.</p>
          <p>-	Ensure goalposts are padded with high-density foam, at least two metres high and 35 millimetres thick. Padding should be in good condition and replaced when worn or damaged.</p>
          <p>-	Make sure qualified first aid personnel, first aid kits, icepacks and a stretcher are available at all times.</p>
          <p>-	Check that telephone access, to contact emergency services, is available.</p>

          <p>You can find gymnastics classes for children as young as <strong>2 years of age</strong>, but many coaches say that it's better to wait until your child is <strong>5 or 6</strong> before enrolling in a serious gymnastics program.</p>
          <p>For younger children, introductory classes should focus on developing body awareness and a love for the sport. Parent-child classes that emphasize climbing, crawling, and jumping are a gentle way for
            children <strong>2 to 3 years</strong> of age to develop their physical coordination and self-confidence.</p>
          <p>(ThroughCo, 2019)</p>
          <br>
          <h6>Benefits: </h6>
          <p>-	Learning and completing a gymnastics routine requires both physical and intellectual use. The left and right brains must work together so that your child's physical awareness and spatial awareness will increase.</p>
          <p>-	Gymnastics is a self-controlled sport, and mastering self-control will ultimately increase self-confidence.</p>
          <p>-	Gymnastics aid in disease prevention by promoting and maintaining a healthy and robust body.</p>
          <p>-	Gymnastics is a weight-bearing exercise that exercises strong, healthy bones. As we age, we have experienced years of decline in bone density. By building strong, healthy bones at an early date, we can reduce the symptoms of osteoporosis in later life.</p>
          <p>-	The most essential thing in gymnastics is flexibility. As you increase your flexibility, you reduce the chance of injury.</p>
          <h6>Safety tips: </h6>
          <p>-	Get a sports physical before starting any new sport.</p>
          <p>-	Always warm up and stretch before doing gymnastics.</p>
          <p>-	Only practice on padded floors, never on a hard surface. Mats should be placed under the equipment and properly secured at all times.</p>
          <p>-	Have a coach or program director who is qualified and is at every practice. A qualified coach will be up to date on the latest safety recommendations.</p>
          <p>-	Have a coach spotting for all new or difficult stunts.</p>
          <p>-	Let the coach know if they're uncomfortable with a gymnastic move. If the coach isn't supportive, tell a parent or an administrator.</p>

          <p>Martial arts are self-defense practices, like karate, judo and tae kwon do.</p>
          <h6>Recommended age:</h6>
          <p><strong>Age 6 and above</strong></p>
          <br>
          <h6>Benefits: </h6>
          <p>-	Martial arts will help children learn self-discipline, restraint, and patience.</p>
          <p>-	A martial artist is known for being fit, flexible and healthy, and your kid will be the same. Jumping, push-ups, and stretching warm-ups are common, and the movement of martial arts itself often challenges your muscles and cardiovascular system.</p>
          <p>-	A kid generally becomes more confident when s/he is involved in Martial arts. The ability to resist the attacker is a powerful feeling. Most martial arts use self-defense as the cornerstone of the entire project.</p>

          <br>
          <h6>Safety tips:</h6>
          <p>-	Any clothes, safety gears, and equipment should be fit your kids entirely. When the clothes are loose, or the equipment is too small, it increases the risk of injury to students and their instructors.</p>
          <p>-	Stretching or proper warm-up is essential to prevent muscle damage in the classroom. And once the day's activities are over, cooling the muscles is also necessary.</p>
          <p>-	When you or your child suspects that he is injured, please tell the coach where it hurts. Delaying medical care will only make the injury more serious, even if it only feels pain, please let the coach know so that they can help the child recover as soon as possible.</p>
